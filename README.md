## Challenges

### Designing the layout and theme of the portfolio

I make it with mobile-first approach. With the resume-like design for the first overview part. The inspiration comes from my high-school resume with black, gray, purple and geometric shape. The color scheme is an improvement from the original one. I generated color scheme from [realtimecolors.com](https://realtimecolors.com/?colors=FFFFFF-11101e-8C89CC-11101d-844fda)

```tailwindcss
main: '#8C89CC',
light: '#A38ECF',
dark: '#8673AA',
accent: '#854FDB',
background: '#11101E',
foreground: '#1D1C2A',
secondary: '#DCDAEB',
text: '#FFFFFF',
```

### Three.js

Using three.js for the first time, it is very overwhelming with all the tools and plugin. I use @react-three/fiber which has good documentation and examples but there are not many tutorials out there. I have to learn by myself and read the source code to understand how it works.
